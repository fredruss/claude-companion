# Claude Code Companion

<img src="app/resources/icon.png" width="128" alt="Claude Code Companion icon">

A desktop companion that lets you monitor Claude Code at a glance. See when it's done, when it needs input, and how much context you've used without having to stare at to your terminal. Also, it's cute.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code CLI

### Setup

1. Clone and install:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fredsourcing/claude-companion
   cd claude-companion
   npm install
   ```
   This installs dependencies and prompts to configure Claude Code hooks. Type `y` to allow.

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

The pet window will appear and float on top of other windows. It automatically updates based on what Claude Code is doing:

- **Reading** - Claude is reading files or searching code
- **Working** - Claude is writing, editing, or running commands
- **Waiting** - Claude needs your permission or has a question
- **Idle** - Claude is waiting for input
- **Done** - Claude finished a task
- **Error** - Something went wrong

The pet also displays the context window usage (input + cache tokens from the latest API call).

### Controls

- **Drag** - Click and drag the pet to move it around your screen
- **Right-click** - Change sticker pack (2 packs currently available + basic SVG pack)
- **Close** - Quit from the dock/taskbar or Activity Monitor/Task Manager

## How It Works

Claude Code Companion uses Claude Code's hook system to receive real-time events:

```
Claude Code (Terminal) --[hooks]--> status.json <--[watching]-- Desktop Pet (Electron)
```

1. When you use Claude Code, hooks send events to a status reporter script
2. The script writes status updates to `~/.claude-companion/status.json`
3. The Electron app watches this file and updates the pet's expression

## Privacy

The companion displays status information in `~/.claude-companion/status.json`.

**What IS captured in status.json:**
- **Tool names** - Read, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.
- **Filenames** - Names of files being read, written, or edited (e.g., `Reading index.ts...`)
- **Command names** - First word of bash commands (e.g., `Running npm...`)
- **Search patterns** - Grep patterns, truncated to 20 characters (e.g., `Searching for "pattern"...`)
- **Thinking snippets** - Brief excerpts of Claude's internal reasoning, truncated to ~40 characters
- **Token counts** - Current context window usage

**What is NOT captured:**
- Claude's responses to you (only internal "thinking" blocks are read)
- Your prompts or questions
- File contents or code
- Full bash commands (only the first word)

All data stays local on your machine and is never sent anywhere.

### Transcript Data

Token counts and thinking snippets are extracted from Claude's transcript file (`~/.claude/projects/.../session.jsonl`), not from hook events. Thinking snippets only appear when using models with extended thinking enabled (like Opus).

## Building from Source

To build distributable installers for your platform:

```bash
cd app
npm run dist        # Build for current platform
npm run dist:mac    # macOS .dmg
npm run dist:win    # Windows .exe
npm run dist:linux  # Linux .AppImage
```

Output goes to `app/dist/`.

Note: macOS builds will show a security warning unless code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate.

## Troubleshooting

### Pet doesn't update when using Claude Code

Check that the hooks are configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep claude-companion
```

If hooks are missing, run `node bin/claude-companion.js setup` from the project root to configure them.

### Pet window doesn't appear

On macOS, you may need to allow the app in System Preferences > Security & Privacy.
